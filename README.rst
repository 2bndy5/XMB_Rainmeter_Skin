XMB
###

This is the home for developing XMB. A suite of skins that imitate the PS3's XMB menu using Rainmeter.

Rainmeter required
##################

The minimum required version of Rainmeter is 3.1, but the `latest stable release <https://www.rainmeter.net>`_ is recommended.

Package Installer
#################

`This repository's releases <https://github.com/
2bndy5/XMB_Rainmeter_Skin/
releases>`_ include a Rainmeter package file called
``XMB_<version>.rmskin``. Open this file
with Rainmeter, follow the prompts, and the packaged files will be
copied/installed appropriately to your Rainmeter skins folder.


Manual Install
##############

Download this repository's zip file and extract the folder
``XMB`` (located in ``Skins``
folder) into the Rainmeter skins folder (defualts to
``C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Rainmeter\skins`` -
unless onedrive manages your user documents folder). If
installing a Rainmeter layout, the aforementioned
`Package Installer`_ is preferred and highly recommended.
